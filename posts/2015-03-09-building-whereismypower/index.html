There are 4 levels of load shedding severities which are used depending on the amount of consumption that needs to be shed from the national grid.</p><p>|&mdash;&mdash;-+&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-|
| Stage | Megawatts to be shed |
|&mdash;&mdash;-+&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-|
| 1 | 1000MW |
| 2 | 2000MW |
| 3A | 3000MW |

{: .table .table-condensed .table-bordered .table-small }</p><p>When load shedding was first implemented, the City of Cape Town municipality released a load shedding schedule which divided Cape Town into 16 broad areas. Each area would be switched on or off as a whole and was represented in the schedule as a number (Area 1, Area 2, Area 3 ..). The initial schedule repeated weekly and designated at which times of day each area was shut off depending on the load shedding stage.</p><p>Here is an example of the initial stage 1 and stage 2 timetables:</p><p><img src=https://astromechza.github.io/images/2015-03-09/s1_2weekly.jpg alt="Stage 1 & 2 Week Timetable">

Therefore an easy to use website that interpreted and presented this data was a necessity.</p><h2 id=tech-stack-overview>Tech stack overview</h2><p>I&rsquo;m most familiar with creating data driven MVC web-apps using <code>Ruby on Rails</code>, so that is what I chose for this project. Coupled with <code>SASS</code>, <code>HAML</code>, and <code>CoffeeScript</code> building the website could go pretty quickly. The code was hosted on Github and initially deployed to Heroku. I chose <code>Postgres</code> as a database. Other helpful development bits were <code>RSpec</code>, <code>SimpleCov</code>, <code>Faker</code>, and <code>FactoryGirl</code> which is a great combination for testing.</p><h2 id=data-collection-v1>Data collection v1</h2><p>The initial problem was collecting the data, the schedules had been published as PDF&rsquo;s which are notoriously difficult to extract data from reliably. I wrote a Python script to take copy pasted table data and convert it into a more readable structure.

{: .img-med-center}</p><p>The most difficult part of the data collection was extracting the irregular 2d areas from the PDF that represented the 16 areas on the map. I wanted to create my own slippy map (pan & zoom) to show the areas so that users could easily identify exactly which area they fell into. The great thing about the PDF provided by the City was that the <strong>area map was still in SVG format!</strong> I used <code>Inkscape</code>, a popular vector graphics editor to load in the PDF and isolate the SVG elements representing the map. I then exported it into a text based representation (*.fx) that could be easily parsed. I worked out a basic understanding of how the format worked I managed to extract the coordinates of the points representing the polygons in page-space. These still needed to be converted into gps coordinate space in order to be shown on a Google Maps canvas. This step was accomplished by identifying 3 key points that I could identify the real gps coordinates for, and building a matrix transform that mapped the <code>x, y</code> coordinates of the SVG points into <code>latitude, longitude</code> coordinates. After processing all the points in this way, I could get accurate maps of each load shedding area.</p><p>{% highlight python linenos=table %}

{: .img-mini}</p><p>As the screenshots above show, I also added a function that polls the Cape Town city load shedding page to identify when load shedding is actually active. The status is shown in a banner at the top of the page. Tags on the schedule pages also highlight the current time row as well the current stage IF load shedding is underway.</p><hr><p>At this point it was around the beginning of December 2015 and the website was seeing regular traffic after being shared on Facebook. I wasn&rsquo;t really interested in monetizing it so I didn&rsquo;t add any advertising. I was still using a Heroku subdomain (capetownpower.herokuapp.com) so it was time to migrate to something better. I bought the <a href=http://whereismypower.co.za>whereismypower.co.za</a> domain (R99) and moved the website to Digital Ocean where I had $100 credit thanks to the Github student pack. These are the only costs so far.</p><p>In January, Cape Town announced it would be moving to a new schedule system. This was annoying. The new system was a result of allegations that the previous schedule was unfair and load shed certain areas less than others. It was converted to a monthly schedule and again made available as a pdf:</p><p><img src=https://astromechza.github.io/images/2015-03-09/pdf_sch2.jpg alt="New Schedule">
{: .img-med-center}</p><h2 id=data-collection-v2>Data collection v2</h2><p>The new schedule was substantially more data. It was easy to see that it followed a pattern so I decided to reverse the algorithm that was used to generate it. This was relatively easy and used a set of sliding, repeating ranges that evenly distributed the load shedding across all areas over the entire month.</p><p>The algorithm was also posted as a Gist <a href=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/AstromechZA/5189b284b7286c8f6301/raw/0269709d78a443d9e1345428f2f588fc8d2a2bac/gen-loadshedding-times>here</a>:
